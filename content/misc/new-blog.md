Title: Starting a new blog

As you can see, I'm currently in the process of starting a new blog with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/).

# Why?

Because Steve Yegge [told me to](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs). I'm also going to republish my previous blogs -- a five month journey in south-east Asia and a old blog I wrote when I lived in California for a year.

But don't worry, knowing me, posts will be few and far between!
